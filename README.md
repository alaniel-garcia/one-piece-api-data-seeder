# one-piece-api-data-seeder

## Description: 

The One Piece Data Seeder repository is responsible for populating the One Piece API's MongoDB database with initial data. It contains the necessary code to generate and insert data into the database, following the defined schema and validations. The repository focuses on the data population process and provides a convenient way to seed the database with pre-defined or custom data.

## Features:

1. Data generation: The repository includes scripts or functions to generate data for various collections, such as characters, races, devil fruits, haki abilities, groups, crews, members, ships, and locations.
   
1. Database interactions: It utilizes Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database, ensuring data integrity and adherence to defined schema validations.
   
1. Customization: The data population process can be customized to suit specific requirements, allowing the addition of custom data fields, relationships, and complex data structures.
   
1. Seeding options: The repository may include options to seed the database with default data, random data, or data sourced from external APIs or files.
Validation and data consistency: The code in this repository applies required fields, uniqueness constraints, and other validations to ensure the generated data meets the expected criteria and maintains data integrity.

By separating the data population logic into its own repository, the One Piece Data Seeder enables easy maintenance and extension of the population codebase, independent of the API implementation. It promotes modular design, code reusability, and facilitates the scalability of the database population process.
